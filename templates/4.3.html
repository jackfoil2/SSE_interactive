the program.  Monitoring includes determining 
if an event has occurred that requires the 
program to reassess CPI or its associated 
protections.  Events may include, but are not 
limited to, the following: 
•  Operational Environment:  A change in 
the physical location of the system with 
CPI other than that for which it was 
originally designed. 
•  Protection Effectiveness:  A change in 
the ability of the CPI protections to 
deter, delay, detect, and respond to 
attempts to compromise CPI (e.g., 
presumed effectiveness of system 
requirements invalidated through cyber 
test). 
•  Security Classification:  A change to a 
relevant SCG, and thus the classification 
thresholds. 
•  System Modification:  A change to the 
system architecture and/or designs. 
•  Capability Maturation:  A change in the 
state-of-the-art for a particular 
capability and thus the thresholds used 
for CPI identification. 
•  Cyber Test Strategy:  A change in the 
cyber test and evaluation strategy.</td><td>• SEP
