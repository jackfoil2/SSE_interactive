As thesystem design evolves, Requirements Analysisactivities support allocation and derivation ofrequirements down to the system elementsrepresenting the lowest level of the design.Formal Cyber Survivability requirementsallocation for subsystem and box-levelspecifications are derived by performing an SRA.Various types of SVPP analyses and tests will beperformed in support of the SRA.  Fundamentalto the SRA are the result of trade studies andthreat system interaction analyses.
