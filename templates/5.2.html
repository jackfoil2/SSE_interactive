The CVI processincludes detailed test planning and execution ofvulnerability, controls, system misuse/abuse,and penetration testing based upon MBCRA andCVI activities conducted to date.Update requirements as necessary.NOTE:  CVI testing typically consists of multipleincremental test events (beginning withindividual sub-components / components andincreasing to end-to-end system testing)spanning the developmental test period andoccasionally into operational test if systemmodifications occur during operational test.Whenever possible, CVI activities should beginduring system development and may includeintegrated contractor/Government cyber testactivities.</td><td>• Updated RiskAssessment• CVI test report(s)• Updated cybertest portions ofCS and TEMP</td><td>• SSWG• CyWG• cyber testagency• SWG</td><td>• USC Title 10,  § 133a, 133b• AFI 99-103• AFPD 17-1• ISO 17666:2016, Space Systems -Risk Management, 1st ed...• DoDD 5000.01• DoDI 5000.90• DoDI 5000.02• DoD Cybersecurity Test andEvaluation Guidebook (Phase 3).• DoD PM Guidebook for Integratingthe Cybersecurity RiskManagement Framework intoSystem Acq Lifecycle• Cybersecurity Principles for SpaceSystems", Federal Register, Vol. 85,No. 176, Title 3, Space PolicyDirective 5, Section 4, p.56157, 4May 2020</td></tr><tr><td>5.2.2.2</td><td>AdversarialCybersecurityDevelopmental Testand Evaluation (ACD)</td><td>Conduct Adversarial Cybersecurity DT&E uponcompletion of the CVI activities and vulnerabilityremediation/mitigation implementation (ideallyon the completed system).
