Document SSE risks in the Program’s Risk 
Management Process and System Safety 
Process.  In addition, capture the pairing of 
threats and vulnerabilities within the MBCRA. 
 
Obtain SSE risk approval from the appropriate 
approving authority (i.e. PM, PEO, SAE, or Chief 
Information Officer (CIO)). 
 
If risk assessment is not approved, return to 
previous steps necessary to mitigate the 
unapproved risks.

Update APA for high-risk potential 
vulnerabilities identified during FTA risk 
assessment, as needed.  Update CTA & cyber 
test methodology as needed based on any new 
or changed potential vulnerabilities. 
 
NOTE:  Ensure all resources used, as well as, the 
analysis processes used, assumptions made, and 
conclusions reached during the  FTA & APA 
analysis activities are clearly codified in program 
documents for later reference (particularly 
during future FTA & APA updates).  Resources 
used for these analyses should be stored in a 
single resource repository.</td><td></td><td>• CyWG</td><td>• Appendix C: Functional ThreadAnalysis (FTA)• Appendix D: Attack Path Analysis(APA)• DoD Cybersecurity Test andEvaluation Guidebook (Phase 2)• Cybersecurity Principles for SpaceSystems", Federal Register, Vol. 85,No. 176, Title 3, Space PolicyDirective 5, Section 4, p.56157, 4May 2020</td></tr><tr><td>1.7.5</td><td>Risk Management</td><td>Integrate risks associated with CPI/CC/TSN/
