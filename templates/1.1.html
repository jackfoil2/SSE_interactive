The CyWG isresponsible for integrating and coordinating allCybersecurity test and evaluation andsupporting the Risk Management Frameworkassessment and authorization process.NOTE:  It is a best practice for LDTO, OTA/OTO,and participating cyber test agencyrepresentatives on the CyWG to also bemembers of the SSWG.</td><td>• PPP Table 1.2-1</td><td>• PM</td><td>• DoDI 5000.83• DoDI 5000.90• DoDI 8510.01• DoDI 8500.01• AFI 99-103• AFMAN 63-119• AFPAM 63-113• "Cybersecurity Principles for SpaceSystems", Federal Register, Vol. 85,No. 176, Title 3, Space PolicyDirective 5, p.56155, 4 May 2020.• DoD Cybersecurity Test andEvaluation Guidebook• National Space Traffic ManagementPolicy", Federal Register, Vol. 83,No. 120, Space Policy Directive 3, p.28969, 21 June 2018.• DASD(SE) “Program Protection PlanOutline & Guidance”</td></tr><tr><td>1.1.2</td><td>Develop SSWGCharter</td><td>Publish a charter with the business rules forSSWG members to ensure Program ProtectionPlanning and documentation is a focused effortbased on well-defined objectives.</td><td>• SSWG Charter• PPP Section 1.2and Table 1.2-1</td><td>• SSWG</td><td>• AFPAM 63-113</td></tr><tr><td>1.1.3</td><td>GatherDocumentation</td><td>Collect relevant/available documentation toassist with the subsequent steps in the process.If modifying an existing system, reviewpreviously identified vulnerabilities of thesystem.
